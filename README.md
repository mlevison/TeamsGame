The game is an attempt to simulate the tradeoffs and choices real agile teams have to make as they become more productive.

As I was designing the game I realized that it was an excellent microcosm to explore/practice test automation of complex business rules.
Beyond the basic affects of each action there a few key challenges
- many actions don't have an immediate benefit but instead affect the team in the next round
- some actions also affect other actions
- some actions have very special terms and are different from others
- randomness is involved in both the number of stories you deliver and the gremlins
